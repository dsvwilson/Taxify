# Taxify

**Welcome!**

I'm trying my hands on a plugin that is supposed to create a custom post type in WordPress and allow merchants to list a state and get the tax rates for that state pulled in via API. I'm going to be dealing with VAT rates alone in the first version of this plugin and will only allow users to input states. Possibly, as time progresses, I might add more features for the plugin to be able to pull in rates automatically based on the WooCommerce store's address/tax settings and add support for more countries. 

This is my first WordPress project. Taxify is what I chose to call this plugin and I claim no right to the name Taxify. Feel free to fork a project, submit a pull request, or read the code. Its open source and free.
